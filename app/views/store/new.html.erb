Real estate websites have to be designed to build trust, given that a home or property is one of the most important purchases somebody ever makes. The buyer has to trust that the real estate agency cares as much about their investment as they do. Once a website does that, it has to convert.<br> <BR>

Intriguing website design by Aneley
A website’s goals depend on the kind of company it’s for, and there are a few different strategies real estate websites use to drive conversions:
<left>
<li>Bringing viewers inside the listed properties and showing them around so that they’re pumped to visit it in person 
<li>Putting a face to a firm’s name, making the viewer feel like they already know the agent or team before they first meet
<li>Giving viewers a crash tour of the area the real estate’s in and everything that’s awesome about it
<li>Using maps to show viewers exactly where listed properties are located, down to the block
Take a look at the ways successful real estate websites put these design strategies into action.

—</h2>
<p>Real estate agencies’ primary goal is to sell (and lease) properties. It’s a whole lot easier to get attractive properties sold and leased, and a website that highlights on beautiful spaces can make sales a cinch.</p>
<p>While this approach requires hiring a professional photographer, the investment is well worth it. When viewers look at spaces online, they’re imagining themselves living and working in those spaces. They’re picturing their families gathered around the dining room table for a meal lit by the crystal chandelier or their teams working together in a fun, comfortable work space that gives their brand a home.</p>
<p>Thus, these viewers need to see authentic, high quality photos of the place. Once you have these images, make sure other site elements like typography and color schemes are toned down so that the photos can really shine.</p>

<p>Website designs that give viewers a walk-through are perfect for real estate agencies that specialize in luxury homes and rentals. The design for Rothstone Development Co. above accomplishes this by putting the viewer inside of a home from the moment the site loads–placing the viewer right in the living room where she can take in the window view of the garden outside. The design for Jayalakshmi Group similarly takes viewers on a virtual tour with a big slider image from the point of view of having just strolled into the office.</p>
